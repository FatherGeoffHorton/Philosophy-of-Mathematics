## A Brief History of Mathematics

I don't pretend to provide anything like a complete history of mathematics. Mathematical philosophy is based firmly in the tradition of Greek thought, and it is Greek thought (influenced by its neighbors) and its descendants upon which I shall focus.

Mathematics grew from two basic needs: the need to *count* and the need to *measure*. How many baskets of wheat do I have? Where does my field end and my neighbor's field begin? (Arguably astronomy should also be in this list.)

From the rudiments of counting and measuring, calculating quickly arises. If I have ten rows of five baskets each, can I find out how many baskets I have without counting them all. If my neighbor wants to trade me his field that's three units long and four units wide for my field that two by five, should I do it? (Obviously issues other than area would also affect such a decision, but the calculation would be part of it.)
