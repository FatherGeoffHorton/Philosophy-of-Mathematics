"Consider the set of all things that exist."

That was the opening phrase of a proposed proof of the existence of God offered in my seminary class on metaphysics.[^Note that this is not "metaphysics" in the popular science-writer sense of "something I don't want to talk about." This is "metaphysics" as the study of being, an attempt to discover what the meaning of *is* is.] Years before, when I was still in college, I'd taken a course on set theory, and I knew that "the set of all things that exist" is a dicey and perhaps meaningless phrase.

When it came time to write my term paper for that course, I wrote it on the question: "Do Sets Exist?" I didn't know then what deep waters I was entering; I didn't even know that "Philosophy of Mathematics" was a subject area in its own right.

Many years later, I was wandering through the bookstore and saw a copy of Morris Kline's *The Loss of Certainty*. The book is controversial, opinionated, tendentious, and laughably wrong nearly every time it touches on the subject of religion. But the middle chapters (after the mauling of ancient philosophy and before the ending rant) are fascinating, at least to a nerd like me. They tell the story of how mathematics grew upon largely unexamined foundations and of the crisis in mathematical thought that ensued when the foundations of mathematics underwent critical examination.

That critical examination was the genesis of philosophy of mathematics as a distinct subject area. What is mathematics about? Are numbers real or just mental constructs? Do mathematicians discover truth or invent/create it? What constitutes a proof of a mathematical theorm? Can anything meaningful be said about infinite quantities?

If you are a mathematician, you will doubtless find places where my statements are incomplete or where you think more elaboration is needed. Likewise, philosophers will find places where I give only a cursory treatment to ideas that are worthy of much more attention. In both cases, I can only plead that I wanted my book to be accessible to non-specialists.
