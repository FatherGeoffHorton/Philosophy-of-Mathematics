## An Excessively Brief History of Philosophy

Change and permanence; one and the many. These two contrasts define much of the history of Western philosophy. How can something change and yet remain itself? What does it mean for one thing to be the same as something else?

One strand of Greek philosophy thought that all change is illusory because change is impossible. The philosopher Zeno came up with several apparent paradoxes to "prove" that change is impossible. The most famous of these is the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise: Achilles and the tortoise will engage in a race. Since Achilles is much faster than the tortoise, he gives the tortoise a head start. Achilles will start at point A, and the tortoise will start at point B, closer to the finish line. By the time Achilles reaches point B, the tortoise has advanced to point C; when Achilles is at point C, the turtle has advanced to point D; and so on; and so (it seems) that no matter how close Achilles gets, he can never pass the tortoise.
