Mathematics and philosophy go together like oil and water--they don't mix, or at least so it might seem. Mathematics is definite, producing clear, precise, certain results; philosophy is notorious for being unable to reach a consensus on what the meaning of "is" is. Does "Philosophy of Mathematics" even make sense?

Up until not that many centuries ago, what we'd now call "science" was just "natural philosophy," the philosophy of natural things. *Philosophy* is (or at least can be) nothing else than the process of taking a systematic look at a field of study. Aristotle, and St. Albert the Great many centuries later, saw no troubles in studying the natural world and in using philosophy to help them do it well.

Even with that in mind, isn't there a difference between the natural world and the world of mathematics? Answering that question requires asking (and answering) philosophical questions about mathematics: *What is mathematics about? In what sense do the things mathematicians exist, compared to the way the things that physicists, chemists, biologists, et al. study exist?* Maybe philosophy does have something to say about mathematics after all!

We can't avoid thinking about philosophical notions. We can only avoid doing it well.[^1] Yet mathematics survived and prospered for several millennia apparently without needing its own formal and distinct field of philosophy.

Historians of mathematics can argue about the sources of mathematics, but it seems to have grown from two basic needs: the need to *count* and the need to *measure*. How many baskets of wheat do I have? Where does my field end and my neighbor's field begin?

From the rudiments of counting and measuring, calculating quickly arises. If I have ten rows of five baskets each, can I find out how many baskets I have without counting them all. If my neighbor wants to trade me his field that's three units long and four units wide for my field that two by five, should I do it? (Obviously issues other than area would also affect such a decision, but the calculation would be part of it.)
